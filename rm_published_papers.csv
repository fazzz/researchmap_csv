Here, we employ comprehensive phosphoproteome analysis, and identify abnormal phosphorylation of 70 kDa subunit of Ku antigen (Ku70) at Ser77/78, which prevents Ku70-DNA interaction, in human AD postmortem brains. The abnormal phosphorylation inhibits accumulation of Ku70 to the foci of DNA double strand break (DSB), impairs DNA damage repair and eventually causes transcriptional repression-induced atypical cell death (TRIAD). Cells under TRIAD necrosis reveal senescence phenotypes. Extracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein, which is released from necrotic or hyper-activated neurons in AD, binds to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) of neighboring neurons, and activates protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) that executes Ku70 phosphorylation at Ser77/78.

The driving force of aggregate formation is the interactions among the peptide molecules, and the sum of the intra-aggregate and solvation terms per monomer is more favorable for larger aggregates. The effect of the cosolvent was then examined by focusing on the mixtures of water with urea and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). It was actually shown that the derivative of the excess chemical potential of a flexible solute species with respect to the cosolvent concentration is determined exactly by the corresponding derivative of the free energy of solvation. The cosolvent effect on the equilibrium of aggregate formation can thus be addressed by comparing the solvation free energies with and without the cosolvent, and both the urea and DMSO cosolvents were found to inhibit the aggregation. The cosolvent-induced change in the solvation free energy was further decomposed into the contributions from the cosolvent and water.

This method is an extension of temperature accelerated molecular dynamics and can also be considered as a variation of replica-exchange umbrella sampling. In the MuSTAR MD, each replica contains an all-atom fine-grained model, at least one coarse-grained model, and a model defined by the collective variables that interacts with the other models in the same replica through coupling energy terms. The coarse-grained model is introduced to drive efficient sampling of large conformational space and the fine-grained model can serve to conduct more accurate conformational sampling. The collective variable model serves not only to mediate the coarse-and fine-grained models, but also to enhance sampling efficiency by temperature acceleration. We have applied this method to Ala-dipeptide and examined the sampling efficiency of MuSTAR MD in the free energy landscape calculation compared to that for replica exchange molecular dynamics, replica exchange umbrella sampling, temperature accelerated molecular dynamics, and conventional MD. The results clearly indicate the advantage of sampling a relatively high energy conformational space, which is not sufficiently sampled with other methods. This feature is important in the investigation of transition pathways that go across energy barriers.
